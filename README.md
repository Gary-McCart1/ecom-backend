# 🛒 E-commerce Backend API (Django + DRF)

This is the backend API for a full-featured e-commerce application built using **Django** and the **Django REST Framework (DRF)**. It provides core functionality for both the customer-facing store and the admin dashboard.

The API handles user authentication (via **Simple JWT** stored in **HttpOnly cookies**), product and order management, and support for admin features like message viewing. It integrates seamlessly with:

- A **storefront frontend** where customers can browse products and place orders
- An **admin dashboard** where business users can manage products, view orders, and read messages
